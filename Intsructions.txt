Instructions: 

SQL CREATION ORDER: Create Tables 'Lab3sql.txt' -> Create Stored Procedure 'JeremyEzellLab3.txt' -> Create Tables & EXEC 'Lab3_AUTH'.txt

Start Page: LoginDecisionPage.aspx

In order to login as a customer you must first create a new customer account; (There are no existing customers from launch)
Then login using the username and password you have just created

Employee Login:
---------------
Username: admin
Password: password

The application will run in any order but I suggest going through it in the following order for clarity;

- Create A New Customer Account
- Login With Your New Account
- Create A Systems Request
- Logout Of Customer Portal And Login As Employee

- On the Employee Side it makes the most sense 
  to follow the above button links in the order they are displayed

Thank You!
